b:T197f,<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>An implementation of Actor Critic method on CartPole-V0 environment.</p>
<h3>Actor Critic Method</h3>
<p>As an agent takes actions and moves through an environment, it learns to map
the observed state of the environment to two possible outputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Recommended action: A probabiltiy value for each action in the action space.
The part of the agent responsible for this output is called the <strong>actor</strong>.</li>
<li>Estimated rewards in the future: Sum of all rewards it expects to receive in the
future. The part of the agent responsible for this output is the <strong>critic</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions
from the actor maximize the rewards.</p>
<h3>CartPole-V0</h3>
<p>A pole is attached to a cart placed on a frictionless track. The agent has to apply
force to move the cart. It is rewarded for for every time step the pole
remains upright. The agent, therefore, must learn to keep the pole from falling over.</p>

<h2>Implement Actor Critic network</h2>
<p>This network learns two functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Actor: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns a
probability value for each action in its action space.</li>
<li>Critic: This takes as input the state of our environment and returns
an estimate of total rewards in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p>In our implementation, they share the initial layer.</p>
